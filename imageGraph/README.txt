This code was used to produce the experimental output of
"Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes" (SIGIR 2015)

FIRST:

Download the starter dataset (Amazon baby clothes) from:
http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/starter/data.tar.gz

And extract it into this folder (so that the files are under the folder "data")

SECOND:

Run "make Baby.out"

This will compile the code and run the experiment on Baby clothing. See the documentation in the files in "src/" to save the models etc.
